```

If you plan to deploy online, also add:

```

### 7. Get Your Client ID

## üìä Google Sheets Format

Your Google Sheet should have these columns:
| Word | POS | Meaning | Sentence Example |
|------|-----|---------|------------------|
| Tease | v. | ÂèñÁ¨ë / Êà≤ÂºÑ | My older brother used to tease me a lot when we were kids. |
| Mean | adj. | ÂàªËñÑÁöÑ / ÂêùÂóáÁöÑ | It was a mean thing to say to her. |

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **Your data stays private**: Only you can access your sheets
- **Local storage**: Client ID is stored locally in your browser
- **No server access**: We never see or store your Google credentials
- **Secure authentication**: Uses Google's OAuth 2.0 standard
- **Revokable access**: You can revoke access anytime in your Google Account settings

## üöÄ Testing with Your Sample Data

Your sheet URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MPMePihCmxXvV2yRZf4o-LUVepdzxQpNDzUtqewIj5k/edit?gid=0#gid=0`

Once authentication is set up:
1. Sign in to Google in the app
2. Use your sheet URL to import the vocabulary
3. The app will access your private sheet securely

## ‚ùó Troubleshooting

### "Origin not allowed" Error
- Add your domain to Authorized JavaScript origins in Google Cloud Console
- Make sure to include both `http://localhost:8000` and `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

### "Access denied" Error
- Check that Google Sheets API and Google Drive API are enabled
- Verify you have view access to the Google Sheet
- Try signing out and signing in again

### "Client ID not found" Error
- Double-check your Client ID is correctly copied
- Make sure you created a "Web application" OAuth client

## üÜò Need Help?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify all APIs are enabled in Google Cloud Console
3. Ensure your Google Sheet contains the correct format
4. Try accessing the sheet directly in Google Sheets to confirm permissions

## üéâ Success!

Once set up, you can:
- Import vocabulary from any of your private Google Sheets
- Share specific sheets with other users by email
- Keep your study materials organized and private
- Access everything securely through the app

The authentication setup is a one-time process. After that, importing from Google Sheets is just a few clicks away!
